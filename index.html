						<h12 class="major">About Me</h12>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello! My introduction to the world of Al was during my final
							year of Bachelors at Anna University, where I graduated in electrical Engineering
							(2015-2019) with an aggregate of 1.8 GPA. I'm currently a master thesis student in my final
							semester of studies at University of Stuttgart and am looking for job opportunities in the
							field of Al.

							The inquisitive nature in me has always kept me looking for opportunities in various
							technologies to understand the potential it offers. This quality of mine motivated me to
							take up multiple work student positions, a research project, and an internship, which got me
							the opportunity to work on the AIoT Framework which was later launched as AIoT Playbook by
							the BCW. The responsibility entrusted on me for being a part of the Playbook can be credited
							to my character as someone who could be relied upon to complete the tasks on time and to the
							expected standard in particular. I was also the recipient of DeutschlandStipendum for
							consecutive years of my master study, which I believe is an attribution to the work I have
							done as extra-curricular projects and the stability in my academic performance over the
							years.
						<div>
							Here is a peak into the technologies that I'm familiar with! -> C, C++, Java, Python, React,
							SQL, MPI, Html, CSS, Linux, LaTeX, Cypher Query, Java Native Interface, Ada (Basic).</div>

						<h12 class="major">Internship</h12>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">My internship was based on predicting characteristic traits, not
							for individuals but for business entities, an innovative idea that I conceptualised. A
							business ecosystem is a purposeful business arrangement between two or more entities to
							create and share collective value for a common set of customers. Present day scenario
							demands a company to manually check particular requirements that they would like to be
							fulfilled in order to get into a collaborative ecosystem with other existing companies. Our
							end goal is to create an automated recommender system which will provide a value addition
							ecosystem for the companies. We expect the system to segregate the companies into their
							respective fields and predict the potential companies in its ecosystem.
						<div>
							Each individual company will be left with a list of potential ecosystem partners that they
							can collaborate with to get their expected value out of the collaboration. In future, the
							system will be further developed into a platform with the recommendation system to get the
							360-degree business value by offering it as a product or service platform.</div>

						<h12 class="major">Research Project</h12>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">The idea to find systems that can give us an edge in large
							computations pushed me to work on this topic. Training and inference of deep neural networks
							are computationally intensive. The computational intensity and memory demands of deep
							learning increase proportionally with increase in size of datasets and complexity of DNNs.
							This requires a very efficient implementation to bring the training time down to a
							reasonable level while preserving the inference accuracy. This report analyses a distributed
							training of a residual neural network architecture used for image classification. The focus
							lies on the implementation of such training with parallelism techniques. The architecture is
							parallelized across the model's input data and the neural network layers, namely Data and
							Model parallelism. PyTorch and message passing interface protocol are considered for the
							execution of these methods. The report summarizes the findings of such practices when
							executed with a training dataset of 50,000 images on a CPU cluster and GPU cluster.
							Parameters such as training time, training accuracy, and loss are the sole contributors to
							deriving conclusions.

						<h12 class="major">AIoT Project</h12>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">The concept proposed dealt with using AI systems in detecting
							leaks which can be
							more efficient and less expensive than traditionally available methods. 20-30% of a
							compressor’s output can be leaked which can account
							for a significant
							source
							of
							wasted energy in an industrial compressed air system.
							Our end goal is to built a system that utilizes AI-based sound analysis to
							detect
							leakages
							in
							pneumatic systems with a goal to evaluate Holistic DevOps and AI/Machine
							learning model
							reuse.Currently, 4 test systems are deployed around the globe, including an installation at
							the Bosch Connectory in Chicago, the Bosch research facility in Shanghai, the TÜV Süd test
							lab in Singapore, as well as the lab HQ in Heilbronn, Germany.</p>
